**# Celebrity Divorce List: The Silliest Reasons They Split**

## Project Overview
This project aims to create a dynamic and personalized list of celebrities who got divorced for ridiculously silly reasons. Users can log in, enter their preferences (e.g., "funniest" or "weirdest reasons"), and view a customized list that changes for each user. The goal is to combine humor with technical skills to demonstrate proof of work across full-stack development concepts

## Key Features

- **User Authentication**: Sign-up/login system with personalized user dashboards.
- **Dynamic Lists**: Personalized lists based on user preferences.
- **Search and Filters**: Filter results by celebrity type or silliness category (e.g., food-related, argument-based).
- **Voting System**: Users can upvote the funniest reasons, creating a leaderboard.
- **Social Sharing**: Share your favorite list on social media platforms.
- **Mobile Responsive Design**: A seamless user experience across devices. 


## Tech Stack
### Frontend
- **React.js**: For building an interactive user interface.
- **CSS Framework**: Tailwind CSS for responsive and stylish design.

### Backend
- **Node.js with Express.js**: To handle server-side logic and API endpoints.

### Database
- **MongoDB**: For flexible and scalable data storage.
  - **Reason for Choice**: MongoDB allows for flexible data structures, which is ideal for handling varying data points like user preferences, celebrity details, and unique "silly reasons" categories.
  
#### Collections
- **Users Collection**: Stores user credentials and preferences.
- **Divorce Reasons Collection**: Stores celebrity names, silly reasons, tags (e.g., "food-related"), and voting data.
- **Votes Collection**: Tracks user votes for leaderboard functionality.

### Authentication
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: To securely manage user sessions.

### Hosting
- **Netlify (Frontend)** and **Heroku (Backend)**.

## Why This Project?
This project is interesting because it blends humor with technical complexity. It showcases:
- **Dynamic Content Creation**: Building lists personalized for each user.
- **Database Design**: Handling complex relationships between user data and silly reasons.
- **Frontend-Backend Integration**: Strengthening full-stack development skills.
- **User Experience Design**: Ensuring the platform is intuitive and engaging.


By working on this project, Iâ€™ll develop key skills like user authentication, API creation, and database management while learning how to create fun, creative applications.
